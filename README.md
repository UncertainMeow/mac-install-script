# macOS Configuration Management System

A comprehensive solution for auditing, managing, and restoring macOS configurations across multiple machines. This system provides automated discovery of your current Mac setup and intelligent restoration on fresh installations.

## Features

### üîç **Complete System Discovery**
- **Homebrew packages**: Formulae, casks, taps, and services
- **Mac App Store applications**: Full inventory with app IDs
- **Direct download applications**: Popular apps not available via package managers
- **System configuration**: Git settings, dotfiles, development tools
- **File locations**: Cloud storage sync status and backup recommendations

### üöÄ **Intelligent Installation**
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Smart detection**: Skips already installed applications
- **Direct download support**: Automated installers for Tailscale, Discord, Notion, Figma, and more
- **Dry-run testing**: Preview changes before applying
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed installation records

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security First**
- **Two-file system**: Separates current state (local) from desired state (version controlled)
- **Strict data classification**: Personal information never leaves your machine
- **Bulletproof .gitignore**: Automatic protection against committing sensitive data

## Quick Start

### 1. Audit Your Current Mac
```bash
./audit.sh
```
Generates `mac-config-base.json` with your current system state.

### 2. Create Your Desired Configuration
```bash
cp mac-config-base.json mac-config-desired.json
# Edit mac-config-desired.json to customize what you want on a fresh Mac
```

### 3. Review File Locations (Optional)
```bash
./file-audit.sh
```
Analyzes your file storage and cloud sync status for backup planning.

### 4. Test Installation
```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```
Preview what would be installed without making changes.

### 5. Deploy to Fresh Mac
```bash
./install.sh
```
Automatically installs and configures everything from your desired state.

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audit.sh                    # Discovers current Mac state
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.sh                  # Installs from desired configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file-audit.sh              # Analyzes file locations and sync status
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ direct-downloads.sh     # Handlers for direct download apps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mac-config-desired.json     # Your customized desired state (safe to commit)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mac-config-base.json        # Current system state (local only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file-locations.json         # File analysis results (local only)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                   # Comprehensive developer documentation
